# Front-End Developer Portfolio

## About
My personal front-end web development portfolio showcasing featured personal projects and an overbrief of my background and skills. This project was originally submitted as the second project for the [Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).

Project review:
> This is one of the coolest designs I have seen for this project.
> Also, I appreciate that you have put good content in the sections instead of putting some random stuff (which most students do).
> The side navbar looks really great.
> The code work is very nice and precise. The IntersectionObserver is nicely used to compute the active section.
> Well done for using arrow functions introduced in ES6.
> I liked that you implemented some extra functionalities like go to top button shown at the bottom of the screen.
> Good luck for the future. :thumbsup:

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Sass, JavaScript
