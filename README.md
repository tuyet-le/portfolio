# Front-End Developer Portfolio

## About
My personal front-end web development portfolio built with the aim of creating elements dynamically. My portfolio showcases featured projects and an overbrief of my background and skills. This project was originally submitted as one of the projects for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program.

Project review:
> This is one of the coolest designs I have seen for this project.
> Also, I appreciate that you have put good content in the sections instead of putting some random stuff (which most students do).
> The side navbar looks really great.
> The code work is very nice and precise. The IntersectionObserver is nicely used to compute the active section.
> Well done for using arrow functions introduced in ES6.
> I liked that you implemented some extra functionalities like go to top button shown at the bottom of the screen.
> Good luck for the future. :thumbsup:
